Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using Feed-forward Neural Networks

## Description / Goals 
Our goal is to develop a sentiment classifier using Feed-forward Neural Networks for a Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset.
We experiment with different word embeddings (tf-idf, GloVe) and parametres as:
* the number of hidden layers, and the number of their units
* the activation functions 
* the loss function
* the optimizer, etc

- We compare our models based on the loss convergence and the basic score metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
- We evaluate our experiments based on the mathematical-theoretical background of each model.  
- We plot the Loss - Epochs diagrams and the ROC curve of our best model to visualize the outcomes of our experiments.
